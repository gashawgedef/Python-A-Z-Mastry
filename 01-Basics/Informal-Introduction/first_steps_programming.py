Python can manipulate text (represented by the type str, so-called “strings”) as well as numbers.
 This includes characters like !, words like rabbit, names such as Paris, and full sentences: Got your back. or even joyful emojis like Yay! :).
Strings can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result."""
